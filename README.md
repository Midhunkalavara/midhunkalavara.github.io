## Introduction:
I am a data analyst and technical writer with a passion for transforming complex information into clear, actionable insights.  I excel at unraveling intricate datasets and translating them into user-friendly documentation.  My background in both technical writing and data analysis allows me to bridge the gap between data and comprehension, ensuring effective communication across all levels.

## About Me:
My professional journey commenced with a Bachelor of Technology in Aeronautical Engineering from Calicut University, which propelled me into a career as an aerospace technical writer. Over time, I transitioned into roles as a senior technical writer, contributing to various hardware and software products.

However, my venture into the realm of data analysis commenced with a newfound passion sparked during an online data science course from IIT Madras. This burgeoning interest motivated me to pursue various online certifications and enabled me to engage in data analysis within my projects, facilitating data-driven decision-making on the Trust Safety knowledge base that I currently manage.

Presently, I am further enhancing my skill set by pursuing a Post Graduate Certificate Program in Data Science and Machine Learning at Manipal Institute of Technology, with an anticipated completion date in September 2024.
